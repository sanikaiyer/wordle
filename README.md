The Game of Wordle

A simple command-line version of the popular word game, Wordle, built in Python. 

## Description

Wordle is a word guessing game where you have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the guessed word:

- **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
- **Gray**: Incorrect letter.

This project is a Python implementation of the game that you can run directly from your terminal.

## Features

- Play the game in the terminal with different word lists.
- Get feedback after each guess in the form of colors (or text) to guide your next guess.
- Limited number of guesses (6).
- Handles incorrect guesses gracefully and informs the player.
